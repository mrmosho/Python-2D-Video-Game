## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Game won't start:**
- Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed
- Install pygame: `pip install pygame`
- Check that `game.py` is in the current directory

**Missing graphics/sounds:**
- The game will run with default graphics if assets are missing
- Create an `assets/` folder and add your files
- Ensure file names match exactly (case-sensitive)

**Poor performance:**
- Close other applications
- Ensure your system meets minimum requirements
- Try reducing window size in the code if needed

**Audio not working:**
- Check system audio settings
- Ensure audio files are in WAV format
- Verify pygame audio is properly initialized

## üîß Customization

### Modifying Game Constants
Edit the constants at the top of `game.py`:
```python
WIDTH, HEIGHT = 800, 600  # Window size
PLAYER_SPEED = 5          # Player movement speed
ENEMY_SPEED = 2           # Enemy movement speed
FLASHLIGHT_LENGTH = 200   # Flashlight range
```

### Adding New Levels
1. Create new level maps in the `generate_level()` function
2. Add corresponding background images
3. Update level progression logic

### Custom Assets
- Replace any file in the `assets/` folder with your own
- Maintain the same file names and formats
- Images will be automatically scaled as needed
